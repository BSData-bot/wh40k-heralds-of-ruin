## Overview ##

__What's this?__

BSData organisation created this project. It's GitHub repository of datafiles.
Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want
to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]

__Wait, where did the 7th edition files go?__

The 7th edition game system will no longer be supported by us; all their files in their last revisions are available [here](https://github.com/BSData/wh40k-heralds-of-ruin/releases/tag/v2.2.1). Downloading .bsr file (one of the Downloads) and importing it in BattleScribe will allow you to use these no-longer-maintained datafiles.
